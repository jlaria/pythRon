# The R language

R is an interpreted language, which means that most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. Thus, users can typically access R through a command-line interpreter, such as conda's command prompt (in Windows) or the terminal (in GNU/Linux). For instance, we can type `2+2`, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (in a terminal) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (in RStudio), the computer replies 4.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

# Objects

In R, *objects* provide a means of accessing data stored in memory. Objects are referred to through *symbols* (variable names) or *variables*. 

## Vectors

Vectors are the most basic objects in R. They can be thought of as contiguous cells containing data. Single numbers, such as `3.14`, and strings, such as `"pi"`, are still vectors (of length 1). Vectors of length 0 are also possible, and often useful.

R has six basic *atomic* vector types, where atomic means all their elements are of the same type. Those basic types are the following.

### Logical

Takes two possible values: `TRUE` (`T`) or `FALSE` (`F`).
```{r, eval=T}
var_logical = TRUE
typeof(var_logical)

vector_logical = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
typeof(vector_logical)

vector_logical[1]

is.logical(vector_logical)

vector_logical[4]
is.logical(vector_logical[4])

```
`NA`(not available) is a special type of data (by default logical).

### Integer

```{r, eval=T}
var_int = 2L
typeof(var_int)

is.integer(var_int)

length(var_int)

var_int
var_int[1]

vector_int = c(var_int, 3L, 8L, 13:18)
typeof(vector_int)

vector_int

length(vector_int)

vector_int[10]

typeof(vector_int[10])
```

### Double (numeric)

```{r, eval=T}
var_double = 3.14
typeof(var_double)
is.double(var_double)
is.numeric(var_double)

var_inf = var_double/0; var_inf
var_nan = 0/0; var_nan
typeof(c(var_inf, var_nan))
```
`Inf` and `NaN` are special types of double.

### Complex

```{r, eval=T}
a = 5.2
b = 1.7
c = complex(real = a, imaginary = b); c
typeof(c)
Re(c)
Im(c)
Mod(c)
Arg(c)
Conj(c)
sqrt(c)
```
### Character

```{r, eval=T}
var_chr1 = "Hola"
var_chr2 = "Mundo"

typeof(var_chr1)

c(var_chr1, var_chr2)

paste(var_chr1, var_chr2)
```

### Raw 
```{r, eval=T}
var_raw = as.raw(40); var_raw
```
Notice the hexadecimal output.
```{r, eval=T}
vect_raw = charToRaw("Hola Mundo"); vect_raw

rawToChar(vect_raw[1:4])

typeof(vect_raw[1:4])
```

## Lists

Lists are another kind of data storage. Lists have elements, but unlike vectors, those elements do not have to be of the same type. Here are some examples.

```{r, eval=T}
my.contact = list(
  name = "Juan C",
  gitpage = "http://github.com/jlaria",
  age = 26,
  tags = c("#data-science", "#r", "#python")
)
my.contact
```
We can access specific element of the list with `$`
```{r, eval=T}
my.contact$tags
typeof(my.contact$tags)
```

## Factors

Factors are special compound objects, used to describe cathegorical data.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
risk = factor(c("hi", "hi", "lo", "med", "lo", "hi")); risk

typeof(risk)

levels(risk)

risk = factor(c("hi", "hi", "lo", "med", "lo", "hi"),
              levels=c("lo", "med", "hi"),
              ordered = T); risk
```

## Matrices

A matrix is a collection of similar object arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are constructed column-wise so entries start in the upper left corner and run down the columns.

```{r}
X = matrix(1:8, nrow = 2, ncol = 4); X

dim(X)

t(X)

norm(X, "F")

rownames(X) = c("obs 1", "obs 2")
colnames(X) = paste("var",1:4)
X
```

Matrices can also be created by column-binding or row-binding.

```{r}
x = 1:4
y = 5:8

cbind(x,y)

rbind(x,y)
```

Multi-dimensional arrays are also posible.

```{r}
A = array(1:24, dim = c(2,4,3)); A
```


# Indexing

R contains several constructs which allow access to individual elements or subsets through indexing operations.

There are three basic indexing operators: `[]`, `[[]]` and `$`. 


```{r, eval=T}
vector_int

vector_int[9]

vector_int[c(2,9)]

X[2,1]

X["obs 2", "var 1"]

A[1,2:3,1:2]
```
Components of vectors can also be named.
```{r, eval=T, collapse=T}
namedvector_int = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
names(namedvector_int) = c("day 1", "day 2", "day 3", "day 4", "day 5")

namedvector_int["day 1"]

namedvector_int[c("day 5", "day 2")]
```

The operator `[[]]` is useful with list vectors. It can be used on atomics, tho.

```{r, eval=T}
my.contact[4] # Returns a list with one element: a character vector

typeof(my.contact[4])

my.contact[[1]] # Returns the character vector 

typeof(my.contact[[1]])
```

The form `$` applies only to lists objects.

```{r, eval=T}
my.contact$name

my.contact$"age"
```

It is also possible to index vectors with `[]` using more complex constructions.

```{r}
a = c(1, 3, 4, -1, 2)
b = c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16)

a[b]

b[-4]

a[c(T,F,T)]

b[risk]

b[]
```

# Operators

R allows the use of arithmetic expressions using operators, which can be grouped using parentheses, mixed with function calls, and assigned to variables in a straightforward manner.

```{r}
x = 2; a = 1
y = 2 * (a + log(x)); y
```

Common vector/matrix opperators are listed here.

```

# Control structures

Computation in R consists of sequentially evaluating **statements**. Statements, such as `a = 1` or `a^2`, can be separated by either `;` or a new line. They can also be grouped together using braces `{` and `}`, forming **blocks**.

## if

The `if/else` statement conditionally evaluates two statements. There is a `condition` which is evaluated and if the value is `TRUE` then the first statement is evaluated; otherwise the second statement will be evaluated.

```{r, eval=F}
if(condition){
  statement 1
}else{
  statement 2
}
```

## Loops

R has three statements that provide explicit looping. They are `for`, `while` and `repeat`. The two built-in constructs, `next` and `break`, provide additional control over the evaluation. R provides other functions for implicit looping such as `tapply`, `apply`, and `lapply`. In addition many operations, especially arithmetic ones, are vectorized so you may not need to use a loop. 

If there is some other way, avoid using loops in R, the former is probably faster.

### for

The syntax of the `for` loop is
```{r, eval=F}
for(object in vector){
  statement
}
```

Notice that if `statement` is only one line, braces `{}` are not required. 

### while

The syntax of the `while` loop is
```{r, eval=F}
while(condition){
  statement
}
```

### repeat 

The syntax of the `repeat` loop is 

```{r, eval=F}
repeat{
  statement
}
```

The `repeat` statement causes repeated evaluation of the body until a `break` is specifically requested. This means that you need to be careful when using `repeat` because of the danger of an infinite loop.

## Implicit loops

The `apply` family of fuctions avoids the explicit use of loop constructs. They manipulate slices of data from matrices, arrays, lists and dataframes in a repetitive way. Here are some important members of this family.

### apply

```{r}
X = matrix(rnorm(4*6), nrow = 4, ncol = 6); X

# We want to compute the mean of each column

col.means = apply(X, 2, mean); col.means

# col.means is a vector and it is equivalent to
col.means_for = rep(0, 6) # declare it
for(j in 1:6){
  col.means_for[j] = mean(X[,j])
}
col.means_for
```

# Data manipulation

## Data frames

Data frames in R can be seen as lists of vectors, all with the same length. They are by far the most useful storage structure for data analysis in R. 
Data frames group vectors together into a 2D tables, where each vector is a column of the table. As happpens with lists in R, each column of a data frame can contain a different type of data, but since columns are vectors, every cell within a column must be of the same type.

There are many ways to create data frames in R, but we rarely have to type the data in R.

```{r}
df = data.frame(name = c("Juan", "Pedro", "Mar√≠a"),
                age = c(26, 33, 22),
                phone = c("666-849334", "666-837489", "666-029340") )
df
```

We can create a data frame from a previously defined 2D data matrix.

```{r}
X = matrix(1:8, nrow = 2, ncol = 4)

df = data.frame(X)
df
```

We can also assign names to columns and rows

```{r}
colnames(df) = paste0("Col", 1:4)
rownames(df) = paste0("Obs", 1:2)

df
```

We can delete and edit columns, rows, and cells.

```{r}
df = data.frame(matrix(rnorm(40), nrow=5, ncol=8))

df$X1 = NULL # delete column 1
df

df[,c(3,6)] = NULL # delete columns 3 and 6
df

df = df[-1, ] # remove row 1
df

df = df[,-c(4:6)] # remove columns 4,5,6
df

df[2,] = -10 # edit row 2
df

df$X5 = 5 # edit column X5
df

```

Data frames with the same colums can be row-concatenated with `rbind`.

```{r}
df1 = data.frame(name = c("Pedro", "Mar√≠a"),
                age = c(33, 22),
                phone = c("666-837489", "666-029340") )
df2 = data.frame(name = c("Juan"),
                age = c(26),
                phone = c("666-849334") )

rbind(df1, df2)
```

Data frames with the same rows can be column-concatenated with `cbind`.
```{r}
df1 = data.frame(name = c("Juan", "Pedro", "Mar√≠a"),
                age = c(26, 33, 22))
df2 = data.frame( phone = c("666-849334", "666-837489", "666-029340") )

cbind(df1, df2)
```

## Data input

### The working directory

Every R session has a default location on the operating system‚Äôs file structure called the working directory.

The fuction `getwd()` tells what the current working directory is.

```{r}
getwd()
```

To change the working directory, use the `setwd` function. Be sure to enter the working directory as a character string (enclose it in quotes).

```{r, eval=F}
setwd("~/juank/Downloads")
```

### Reading data

The `read.table` function reads a file in table format and automatically creates a data frame from it, with cases corresponding to rows and variables to columns in the file.

```{r}
df = read.table("data/protein.csv",
                header = T,
                sep = ",")
head(df)
```
